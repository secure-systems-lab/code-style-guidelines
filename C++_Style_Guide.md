# Secure Systems Lab C/C++ Style Guide

These guidelines provide examples of what to do (or not to do) when writing
C/C++ code for the projects of the Secure Systems Lab in the NYU Tandon School
of Engineering.

The style guide provided here is intended to improve the readability of code and
make it consistent across the wide spectrum of C/C++ code. The features that your
code must have are readability, security, correctness, robustness and performance.

In general for C/C++ programming languages we use [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

Since security is an importan for Secure Systems Lab, we also should follow some
security rules.

* For secure C++ coding please have a look follow link:
[The C++ rules.](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=637)

* For secure C coding please have a look follow link:
