# Secure Systems Lab C/C++ Style Guide

These guidelines provide examples of what to do (or not to do) when writing
C/C++ code for the projects of the Secure Systems Lab in the NYU Tandon School
of Engineering.
The features that your code must have are readability, security, correctness,
robustness and performance.
In general for C/C++ programming languages we use Google C++ Style Guide.

As security is an importan for Secure Systems Lab we also should follow some
security standards.
